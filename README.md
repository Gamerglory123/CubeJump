Hello there! I see you want to check around our code and maybe change some stuff! Well, i've included some tools for that!

The original Scratch .sb3 file is included (for betas as well)
I've included a Level Designer too in html and .sb3 formats (although it is seperate from the original game)
There is also some extra stuff for you to play around with!
